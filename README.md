## Overview

As a DevOps engineer, my work focuses on automating, optimizing, and managing cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes to ensure high availability, scalability, and security for applications. This repository demonstrates my experience with various tools and platforms used in DevOps practices.

## Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the tools and technologies I have used across different projects:

- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, TeamCity
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, ECS, etc.), Azure, GCP
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, CloudWatch
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, Bitbucket
- **Other Tools:** SonarQube, Trivy, Nginx, Python scripting

## Projects

### CI/CD Pipelines

- **[Multi-Branch Jenkins Pipeline](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for multi-branch builds, code quality checks with SonarQube, and automated deployment to production.
  
- **[GitHub Actions for Code Scanning](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Code scanning using SonarQube with a manual trigger in GitHub Actions for projects like Node.js and .NET.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **[AWS Infrastructure Setup with Terraform](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Provisioned AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, VPC, and RDS) using Terraform. Includes modular configurations for reusability.

- **[Ansible Playbooks for Automation](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Automated deployment of applications, configurations, and server setups using Ansible across environments.

### Containerization

- **[Kubernetes Microservices Deployment](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Deployed microservices architecture on Kubernetes with Helm for managing dependencies and scaling.

- **[Dockerized Full-Stack Application](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Built and deployed a full-stack application with Docker Compose, optimized images, and automated builds.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **[Prometheus & Grafana Setup for Docker Monitoring](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Configured Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of Docker containers and application metrics.

- **[ELK Stack for Centralized Logging](link_to_repo_folder)**
  - Description: Set up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) for centralized log management and analysis of server logs.
